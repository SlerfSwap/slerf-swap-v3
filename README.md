## Key Features
- Concentrated liquidity with customizable price ranges for LPs
- Five fee tiers (0.00%, 0.06%, 0.10%, 0.30%, 1.00%) with a 30% protocol share on non-zero tiers
- Optimized for X-Layer throughput and low-gas execution paths
- Native WOKB support across core and periphery components
- Standalone deployment with verifiable `POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH`

## Architecture Overview

### Core Contracts
- `SlerfSwapV3Factory`: creates pools, tracks fee tiers, manages protocol-level parameters
- `SlerfSwapV3Pool`: automated market maker with concentrated liquidity support
- `SlerfSwapV3PoolDeployer`: deterministic pool deployment helper with hashed bytecode

### Periphery Contracts
- `SlerfSwapV3SwapRouter`: user-facing swap router for single and multi-hop swaps
- `SlerfSwapV3QuoterV2`: gasless price quoting endpoint for off-chain tooling
- `SlerfSwapV3NonfungiblePositionManager`: mints and manages LP NFT positions
- `SlerfSwapV3TickLens` and `SlerfSwapV3PositionDescriptor`: read helpers for UI dashboards

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20 or newer
- Hardhat toolchain or Remix IDE
- MetaMask wallet configured for X-Layer endpoints
- Access to deployed Factory and WOKB addresses listed above

### Recommended Workflow
1. Deploy or verify `SlerfSwapV3Factory` and `SlerfSwapV3PoolDeployer`.
2. Confirm the `poolInitCodeHash` matches the deployed bytecode in both core and referencing libraries.
3. Update periphery constructor parameters (factory, WOKB, position descriptor) before deployment.
4. Deploy periphery contracts (router, quoter, tick lens, position manager) and verify on X-Layer explorers.
5. Register fee tiers and enable pools via the factory initializer.

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Hardhat compilation
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deployment Scripts
```bash
# Deploy to X-Layer testnet (configure RPC and keys beforehand)
npm run deploy:testnet

# Deploy to X-Layer mainnet
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

## Fee Model
- Supported fee tiers: 0.00%, 0.06%, 0.10%, 0.30%, 1.00%
- Liquidity providers accrue fees proportionally to their active liquidity range
- Non-zero fee tiers divert 30% of collected fees to the protocol when the fee switch is enabled

| Tier | Total Swap Fee | LP Share (70%) | Protocol Share (30%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% |
| 0.06% | 0.06% | 0.042% | 0.018% |
| 0.10% | 0.10% | 0.070% | 0.030% |
| 0.30% | 0.30% | 0.210% | 0.090% |
| 1.00% | 1.00% | 0.700% | 0.300% |
